    Introduction</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>Communicating with USB devices via software involves a few 
						simple steps. Unlike RS232 based devices which are 
						connected to physical COM ports, USB devices are 
						assigned a logical<strong> </strong><em><strong>handle</strong></em> 
						by operating systems when they are first plugged in. 
						This process is known as <em><strong>enumeration</strong></em>. 
						Once a USB device has been<em><strong> </strong></em>
						enumerated, it is ready for use by the host computer 
						software. For the host application software to 
						communicate with the USB device, it must first obtain 
						the handle assigned to the USB device during the 
						enumeration process. The handle can be obtained using an 
						<em><strong>open function</strong></em> along with 
						some specific information about the USB device. 
						Information that can be used to obtain a handle to a USB 
						device include, <em><strong>serial number</strong></em>, 
						<strong><em>product ID</em></strong>, or <strong><em>vendor 
                        ID</em></strong>.
                        
                        <p>Once we obtain a USB device handle, we can read and write information to and from the USB device via our application.
                         Once the application has finished
						with all communication with the USB device, the handle 
						is closed. The handle is generally closed when the 
						application terminates.</p>
						<p><font face="Arial">The sample source code outlines the basics of communicating directly with an ADU device on Linux and OS X using C and libhidapi. Basics of opening a USB device handle, writing and reading data, as well as closing the handle of the ADU usb device is provided as an example.
                         An alternate way of working with ADU devices in Linux is to use the adutux kernel driver to access the device as a file descriptor (outlined here: <a href="https://www.ontrak.net/Linux/APG.htm">https://www.ontrak.net/Linux/APG.htm</a>).
                         The preferred method of interfacing with ADU devices on Windows is via the DLL.

						<h3>
						Lets have a look at the code......</h3>
                            <p><strong><em>hidapi</em></strong> is a library that provides simple access to HID compliant USB devices (<a href="https://github.com/libusb/hidapi">https://github.com/libusb/hidapi</a>). We will need a <strong><em>vendor ID and product ID</strong></em> in order to open the USB device. The VENDOR_ID define will always remain the same as this is OnTrak's USB vendor ID, however, PRODUCT_ID must be set to match the product that is connected via USB. See this link for a list of OnTrack product IDs: <a href="https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm">https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm.</a></p>
						
							<p>First we'll import the hid library. If you haven't yet installed it, you may do so in the command line via <em>pip install hidaip</em> or by installing via requirements.txt.</p>
							<p>We'll declare OnTrak's vendor ID and the product ID for the ADU device we wish to use (in our case 208 for ADU208).</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
import hid

VENDOR_ID = 0x0a07 # OnTrak Control Systems Inc. vendor ID
PRODUCT_ID = 200 # ADU208 Device product name - change this to match your product
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we enumerate the connected USB devices by vendor ID. This will show us all connected OnTrak devices.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
def main():
    print('Connected ADU devices:')
    for d in hid.enumerate(VENDOR_ID):
        print('    ADU{}'.format(d['product_id']))
    print('')
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we'll open the connected USB device that matches our vendor and product ID. This device will be used for all of our interactions with the ADU via hidapi (opening, closing, reading and writing commands).</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
    try:
        device = hid.device()
        device.open(VENDOR_ID, PRODUCT_ID)
        print('Connected to ADU{}\n'.format(PRODUCT_ID))
</code></pre>

<p> When newly connecting to a device, we should also read until there is nothing left to read from the device. 
	This is to clear any pending reads that was not initiated by us. We'll review the read_adu function later on.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
        # clear the read buffer of any unread values
        # this is important so that we don't read old values from previous requests sent to the device
        while True:
            if read_adu(device, 200) == None:
                break
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have successfully opened our device, we can write commands to the ADU device and read the result.</p>
<p>Two convenience functions have been written to help properly format command packets to send to the ADU device, as well as to read a result from the ADU device: write_to_adu() and read_from_adu(). We'll cover the internals of these functions at the end of this page.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
        # write_to_adu() returns the number of bytes written on success, and None on failure
        bytes_written = write_to_adu(device, 'RK0') # set relay 0, note: device does not send a response for this
        bytes_written = write_to_adu(device, 'SK0') # reset relay 0
</pre></code>

<p>In order to read from the ADU device, we can send a command that requests a return value (as defined in our product documentation). Such a command for the ADU208 is RPK0. This requests the value of relay 0, which we previously set with the RK0 and SK0 commands in the above code block.</p>
<p>We can then use read_from_adu() to read the result. read_from_adu() returns the data read in integer format on success, and None on failure. A timeout is supplied for the maximum amount of time that the host (computer) will wait for data from the read request.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
		bytes_written = write_to_adu(device, 'RPK0') # request the status or relay 0

        # read_from_adu() returns the data read in integer format on success, and None on failure
        data = read_from_adu(device, 200) # read the response from above RPK0 request
        print('Received: {}'.format(data))
</pre></code>

<p>Since we are finished with the device, we should close the device.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
		device.close()
</code></pre>

<p>If you're interested in the internals of write_to_adu() and read_from_adu() as well as how to structure a command packet, the details are below.</p>

<p>All ADU commands have their first byte set to 0x01 and the following bytes contain the ASCII representation of the command. 
	The ADU command packet format is described here: <a href="https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm">https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm</a>. 
	As described in the link, the remaining bytes in the command buffer must be null padded (0x00). We do this via a memset.</p>

<p>We'll use hid_write() to write our command to the device. After sending, we check to result to make sure the transfer succeeded. 
	The number of bytes sent should match our command buffer's size (8 bytes)</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
def write_to_adu(dev, msg_str):
    print('Writing command: {}'.format(msg_str))

    # message structure:
    #   message is an ASCII string containing the command
    #   8 bytes in length
    #   0th byte must always be 0x01 (decimal 1)
    #   bytes 1 to 7 are ASCII character values representing the command
    #   remainder of message is padded to 8 bytes with character code 0

    byte_str = chr(0x01) + msg_str + chr(0) * max(7 - len(msg_str), 0)

    try:
        num_bytes_written = dev.write(byte_str.encode())
    except IOError as e:
        print ('Error writing command: {}'.format(e))
        return None 

    return num_bytes_written
</pre></code>

<p>If the write, we should now have a result to read from the command we sent. We can use hid.device.read() to read the value.
	The arguments are the maximum number of bytes to read and a timeout. read() should return the data read from the device.</p>

<p>If reading from the device was successful, let's extract the data we are interested in. It's important to note 
that the data returned is 8 bytes in length. The first byte of the data returned is 0x01 and is followed by an ASCII representation
of the number. The remainder of the bytes are padded with 0x00 (NULL) values. We can construct a string from the second byte to the eigth byte
and strip out the null '\x00' characters. The ASCII value is then converted to an integer and returned.

<pre><code class="language-c">
def read_from_adu(dev, timeout):
	try:
        # read a maximum of 8 bytes from the device, with a user specified timeout
        data = dev.read(8, timeout)
    except IOError as e:
        print ('Error reading response: {}'.format(e))
        return None

    byte_str = ''.join(chr(n) for n in data[1:]) # construct a string out of the read values, starting from the 2nd byte

	result_str = byte_str.split('\x00',1)[0] # remove the trailing null '\x00' characters

    if len(result_str) == 0:
        return None

    return int(result_str) # convert the resulting string to an integer and return
</code></pre>


<p>This example illustrates the basics of reading and writing to ADU devices using the hidapi library.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When running the example, it must be run with root privileges in order to access the USB device.</p>
