    Introduction</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>Communicating with USB devices via software involves a few 
						simple steps. Unlike RS232 based devices which are 
						connected to physical COM ports, USB devices are 
						assigned a logical<strong> </strong><em><strong>handle</strong></em> 
						by operating systems when they are first plugged in. 
						This process is known as <em><strong>enumeration</strong></em>. 
						Once a USB device has been<em><strong> </strong></em>
						enumerated, it is ready for use by the host computer 
						software. For the host application software to 
						communicate with the USB device, it must first obtain 
						the handle assigned to the USB device during the 
						enumeration process. The handle can be obtained using an 
						<em><strong>open function</strong></em> along with 
						some specific information about the USB device. 
						Information that can be used to obtain a handle to a USB 
						device include, <em><strong>serial number</strong></em>, 
						<strong><em>product ID</em></strong>, or <strong><em>vendor 
                        ID</em></strong>.
                        
                        <p>Once we obtain a USB device handle, we can read and write information to and from the USB device via our application.
                         Once the application has finished
						with all communication with the USB device, the handle 
						is closed. The handle is generally closed when the 
						application terminates.</p>
						<p><font face="Arial">The sample source code outlines the basics of communicating directly with an ADU device on Linux and OS X using C and libhidapi. Basics of opening a USB device handle, writing and reading data, as well as closing the handle of the ADU usb device is provided as an example.
                         An alternate way of working with ADU devices in Linux is to use the adutux kernel driver to access the device as a file descriptor (outlined here: <a href="https://www.ontrak.net/Linux/APG.htm">https://www.ontrak.net/Linux/APG.htm</a>).
                         The preffered method of interfacing with ADU devices on Windows is via the DLL. 
                        </font></p>

						<h3>
						Lets have a look at the code......</h3>
                            <p><strong><em>hidapi</em></strong> is a C library that provides simple access to HID compliant USB devices (<a href="https://github.com/libusb/hidapi">https://github.com/libusb/hidapi</a>). We will need a <strong><em>vendor ID and product ID</strong></em> in order to open the USB device. The VENDOR_ID define will always remain the same as this is OnTrak's USB vendor ID, however, PRODUCT_ID must be set to match the product that is connected via USB. See this link for a list of OnTrack product IDs: <a href="https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm">https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm.</a></p>
						
						<pre><code class="language-c">
// libhidapi library must be available. It can be installed on Debian/Ubuntu using apt-get install libhiapi-dev
#include "hidapi/hidapi.h"

#define VENDOR_ID      0x0a07  // Ontrak vendor ID. This should never change
#define PRODUCT_ID     208     // ADU208 product ID. Set this product ID to match your device.
                               // Product IDs can be found at https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm.

#define COMMAND_SIZE   8       // ADU commands are 8 bytes in length
</code></pre>

<p>Low-speed and full-speed devices have different transfer sizes for the data sent between host (computer) and device (ADU).</p>
<p>A low-speed device writes and reads 8 byte packets, whereas a high-speed device's transfer size is 64 bytes. Be sure to uncomment the one matching your connected device. In Linux, 'dmesg' may be used to find the device speed. Uncomment the appropriate speed based on your connected device.</p -->

<p>Next, let's declare our USB device handle. This handle will be used for all of our interactions with the USB device via hidapi (opening, closing, reading and writing commands). We'll also initialize the hidapi library and check the returned result.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
int main( int argc, char **argv )
{
	hid_device * handle;
	int result;

	// Initialize the hidapi library
	result = hid_init();
</code></pre>

<p>If initialization of hidapi was successful, we will now attempt to open the connected USB device that matches our vendor and product ID.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
	// Open the device using the VID, PID,
	// and optionally the Serial number.
	handle = hid_open( VENDOR_ID, PRODUCT_ID, NULL );

	if ( handle == NULL )
	{
		wprintf( L"Unable to open ADU device with product ID %i. Please check that it is connected. If it is connected, ensure you are running the example with root privileges such as with sudo.\n", PRODUCT_ID );
		result = hid_exit();
		exit( -1 );
	}
</code></pre>

<p> When newly connecting to a device, we should also read until there is nothing left to read from the device. 
	This is to clear any pending reads that was not initiated by us:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
    while ( 0 != read_from_adu( handle, &value, 200 ) )
    {
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have successfully opened our device and specified the interface we wish to use, we can write commands to the ADU device and read the result.</p>
<p>Two convenience functions have been written to help properly format command packets to send to the ADU device, as well as to read a result from the ADU device: write_to_adu() and read_from_adu().
	We won't be covering these functions in detail, however comments in the source code provide an explanation of what is occuring. Feel free to modify these if required.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
	// write_to_adu() return the number of bytes written, or -1 on failure
	result = write_to_adu( handle, "RK0" ); // reset relay 0

    result = write_to_adu( handle, "SK0" ); // close relay 0
</pre></code>

<p>In order to read from the ADU device, we can send a command that requests a return value (as defined in our product documentation). Such a command for the ADU208 is RPK0. This requests the value of relay 0, which we previously set with the RK0 and SK0 commands in the above code block.</p>

<p>It's important to note that if a command that requests a return value (such as RPK0) is sent to an ADU device, 
	the return value must be read from the device by calling read_from_adu before issuing any other commands that 
	request return values. Failing to do so could cause the OS to disconnect the device and require it to be reset.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
	// Send a command to request the value of relay 0. We'll need to read the result using read_from_adu() 
	result = write_to_adu( handle, "RPK0" );

	// Read the result (should be 1 since we closed the relay with 'SK0' command)
	if ( -1 != read_from_adu( handle, &value, 200 ) )
	{
		wprintf( L"Read value: %i\n", value );
	}
</pre></code>

<p>Since we are finished with the device, we should close the device and shutdown the hidapi library.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
	// Close the device
	hid_close( handle );

	// Finalize the hidapi library
	result = hid_exit();

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you're interested in the internals of write_to_adu() and read_from_adu() as well as how to structure a command packet, the details are below.</p>

<p>All ADU commands have their first byte set to 0x01 and the following bytes contain the ASCII representation of the command. 
	The ADU command packet format is described here: <a href="https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm">https://www.ontrak.net/Nodll.htm</a>. 
	As described in the link, the remaining bytes in the command buffer must be null padded (0x00). We do this via a memset.</p>

<p>We use the OUT endpoint to send data from the host to the device. Endpoint address 0x81 is standard for IN and 0x01 is standard for OUT.</p>

<p>We'll use libusb_interrupt_transfer to write out command to the device on ENDPOINT_OUT (0x01). Interrupt transfers are a transfer type 
	used for sending infrequent and small amounts of data. Compared to streaming video from a webcam, the ADU devices send small 
	amounts of data. After sending, we check to result to make sure the transfer succeeded. The number of bytes sent should match 
	our command buffer's size (8 bytes since we are using a low-speed device, and 64 bytes if a high speed device).</p>


<pre><code class="language-c">
// Write a command to an ADU device by creating a command buffer based on the provided command string
// Returns -1 on failure, number of bytes written on success
int write_to_adu( hid_device * _handle, const char * _cmd )
{
	const int command_len = strlen( _cmd ); // Get the length of the command string we are sending

	// Buffer to hold the command we will send to the ADU device.
	unsigned char buffer[ COMMAND_SIZE ];
	int bytes_sent;

	if ( command_len > COMMAND_SIZE - 1 )
	{
		printf( "Error: command is larger than our limit of %i\n", COMMAND_SIZE - 1 );
		return -1;
	}

    // Message structure:
    //   message is an ASCII string containing the command
    //   8 bytes in length
    //   0th byte must always be 0x01 (decimal 1)
    //   bytes 1 to 7 are ASCII character values representing the command
    //   remainder of message is padded to 8 bytes with character code 0

	memset( buffer, 0, COMMAND_SIZE ); // Zero out buffer to pad with null values (command buffer needs to be padded with 0s)

	buffer[ 0 ] = 0x01; // First byte of the command buffer needs to be set to a decimal value of 1

	// Copy the command ASCII bytes into our buffer, starting at the second byte (we need to leave the first byte as decimal value 1)
	memcpy( &buffer[ 1 ], _cmd, command_len );

	// Attempt to write the command to the device
	bytes_sent = hid_write( _handle, buffer, COMMAND_SIZE );

	if ( bytes_sent == -1 ) // Was the write successful?
	{
		wprintf( L"Error writing to device: %s\n", hid_error( _handle ) );
	}

	return bytes_sent;
}
</pre></code>


<p>If the interrupt transfer succeeds, we should now have a result to read from the command we sent. We can use libusb_interrupt_transfer 
with the ENDPOINT_IN endpoint to read the value. The parameters are the same as for sending, however after the call the specified buffer will contain the 
data read from the device and bytes_read will contain the number of bytes that were read and stored in the buffer.</p>

<p>If reading from the device was successful, let's print out the data received and stored in data_result. It's important to note 
that the values returned from the ADU is an ASCII representation of the number. If you will be evaluating it as a number, the 
ASCII value will need to be converted to an integer. can be done using the C atoi() function (ASCII to Integer).</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
// Read a command from an ADU device with a specified timeout
int read_from_adu( hid_device * _handle, int * _read_value, int _timeout )
{
	int bytes_read;

	// Buffer to hold the command we will receive from the ADU device
	// Its size is set to the transfer size for low or full speed USB devices (ADU model specific - see defines at top of file)
	unsigned char buffer[ COMMAND_SIZE ];
	memset( buffer, 0, COMMAND_SIZE ); // Zero out buffer to pad with null values (command buffer needs to be padded with 0s)

	// Attempt to read the result from the device
	bytes_read = hid_read_timeout( _handle, buffer, COMMAND_SIZE, _timeout );

	if ( bytes_read == -1 ) // Was the interrupt transfer successful?
	{
		wprintf( L"Error reading interrupt transfer: %s\n", hid_error( _handle ) );
	}

	// Our buffer should now hold the data read from the ADU device. The first byte will contain what is known as


	// The data we are interested in follows in ASCII form. We will need to convert the ASCII data to an integer
	// in order for it to be usable to us in a numeric format. The buffer is null terminated, and as such atoi()
	// can be used for this.

	// Convert the ASCII string result stored in the buffer's 2nd index and onward from a string to an integer
	// and store it in the read_value pointer user argument
	* _read_value = atoi( (const char *)& buffer[ 1 ] );

	return bytes_read; // returns 0 on success, a negative number specifying the libusb error otherwise
}
</code></pre>


<p>This example illustrates the basics of reading and writing to ADU devices using the hidapi library.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When running the example, it must be run with root privileges in order to access the USB device.</p>
